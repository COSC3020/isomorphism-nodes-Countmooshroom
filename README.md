# Isomorphism

Prove that if two graphs $A$ and $B$ do not have the same number of nodes, they
cannot be isomorphic. I have started with the formal definition of isomorphism
below. Add your answer to this markdown file. [This
page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions)
might help with the notation for mathematical expressions.

$G_1=(V_1 , E_1)$ is isomorphic to $G_2 = (V_2, E_2)$ if there exists a
one-to-one and onto function (bijection) $f: V_1 \rightarrow V_2$ such that $(u,v)
\in E_1$ iff $(f(u),f(v)) \in E_2$.

## Answer

Let's say $A$ and $B$ are graphs.  They do not have the same number of nodes.  Let's assume that they are isomorphic to each other.
By the definition, there must be a bijection between the nodes of graphs $A$ and $B$.  However, you cannot have a bijection since there are a different number of nodes in each graph, so there is a contradiction.  Therefore, if graphs $A$ and $B$ do not have the same number of nodes, they cannot be isomorphic.
